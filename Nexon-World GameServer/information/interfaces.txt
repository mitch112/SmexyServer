	I can't believe I'm going to starve down here.<br><br>If you've found this, I hope you have better luck than me. I was carrying tools for the Death Guard when shadows attacked us. The team outside died while I got pulled in to the Temple and was teleported to this...place.<br><br>I've just about given up trying to understand the trees here. They reflect light, and I could rotate them when I first came here, but I just don't have the strength any more .<br><br>I hope this helps you: the cores not only reflect, but can be charged. If light enters from behind, it passes through and mixes lights together. As for the receivers, perhaps they have something to do with the colour wheel?

	Surok Magis,
	Your actions are being watched. We know what you are trying to do and the VPSG will stop you! Do not attempt to leave the palace or you will be arrested on sight. We will not hesitate to kill you if you disobey King Roald's orders.                                                                                            Rat Burgiss

	To My Business Partner,
	All is well here, my friend.                  I will continue with my work. You do not need worry. They suspect nothing, the fools! In three days there will be a new King in Varrock!                                                                        Surok Magis

	Instructions for Beacon Ring
	Use this ring when you are ready to summon me to your aid. It is a daunting task, yet you must battle the king to allow me to remove the spell from him. When the king is almost dead, use this ring and I will teleport to your aid. Be warned - Though I am skilled with magic, I am no fighter! Should you summon me too early I will have to teleport us out of danger! When our mission is completed, I will remove the summon ability from this ring, but you may keep it for protection.                                   Zaff

	Watch out for rabbits wandering around the farmyard. They are hungry and will look for flags, as they often mean hidden food! If a rabbit eats the seed under a flag, you will not get any points for it and will lose the flag. 
	You can improve your Hunter skill by finding ogleroots in the farmyard and feeding them to the rabbits. Ogleroots are magical vegetables and will cause the rabbit to disappear for a short amount of time.

	Farmer Blinkin's Vinesweeper Instructions
	1. Speak to either Mrs. Winkin in the barn or Farmer Blinkin outside to buy some flags.
686
	Right-click on an item in the shop to see the available options.
	Proceed
687
	Use a spade to dig in the farmer's field and try to work out where the seeds have been planted. Try not to dig up the seeds, as this will lose you points! Usually, when you dig a square, you will uncover a number, which shows how many seeds are in the holes next to it.
	Plant your flags in holes where you think that seeds may be found. If you are correct, you will get lots of points, but if you are wrong, you will lose the flag. If you are close to other players, you might get some points if they find seeds, too!"
688
	While you are in the area, you will be able to see your points total in the top-right corner of your screen. Your points are saved, so you can leave if you wish and return another time to pick up from where you left off.
	You can trade your points in for prizes or Farming experience by speaking to Mrs. Winkin in the Winkin shop.
689
	Points
	None
690
	Farmers wander the area looking for seeds that have been dug up by mistake. They will also collect any flags you have placed, resetting the nearby area and giving you points if the flag is in the right place.
	If you place a flag over a seed, you will be able to get the flag back from Mrs. Winkin or Farmer Blinkin. If you placed a flag wrongly, you will have to pay 500gp for a new one.

	Item/note withdrawal: Clicking this button toggles how you withdraw items from your bank. `Item' mode places the actual item in your inventory; `Note' mode places a `noted' version of that object in your inventory. A note is worth the exact same value as the item it depicts, but is not the item itself and cannot be used as such. Notes are typically used for trading in bulk, as noted items can be stacked even if the actual item cannot be.
	Deposit carried items and worn items. One button empties all of the items from your inventory, while the other moves all of the items you are wearing into your bank, if there is space. Items that cannot be placed in your bank will stay where they are.

	Select Complexity
	The complexity of a dungeon determines how many of your skills and abilities will be tested in a raid. Choosing a lower complexity will make the dungeon more straight-forward to complete, but it will also lower the Dungeoneering XP reward you receive at the end.<br><br>When you first start Dungeoneering, only complexity 1 will be unlocked. You must complete at least one raid at that complexity before you can unlock the next.

	Item/note withdrawal: Clicking this button toggles how you withdraw items from your bank. `Item' mode places the actual item in your inventory; `Note' mode places a `noted' version of that object in your inventory. A note is worth the exact same value as the item it depicts, but is not the item itself and cannot be used as such. Notes are typically used for trading in bulk, as noted items can be stacked even if the actual item cannot be.
	Deposit carried items and worn items. One button empties all of the items from your inventory, while the other moves all of the items you are wearing into your bank, if there is space. Items that cannot be placed in your bank will stay where they are.
