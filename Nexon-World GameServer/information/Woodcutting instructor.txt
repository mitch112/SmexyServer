99 woodcutting when you get 99 wc:

Wow! It's not often I meet somebody as accomplished 
as you in Woodcutting! Seeing as you're so skilled,
maybe you are interested in buying a Skillcape of
Woodcutting?

No, thanks.

Okay. Come back to me if you change your mind.

Yes, please.

Anybody who has spent as much time cutting trees as
you deserves the right to own one. That'll be 99000
coins, please.

99000! That's too rich for me.

Well, go chop down a few mahogany trees and sell the
timber; then you'll be able to afford one.


No problem.

Excellent! Wear that cape with pride my friend.
