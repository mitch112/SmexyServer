Hello there, Itzz Steven, what can I help you with?

How am I doing so far? -

You're currently assigned to kill cockatrices; only 63 more to go

Who are you? -

My name's Vannaka; I'm a Slayer Master.

Got any tips for me? -

Cockatrices, like balisiks, have a gaze which will paralyse 
and harm their prey. You'll need a mirror shield to
protect you. If you are brave enough, head to Slayer
Caves east of Rellekka  

Where are you? -

You'll find me in Edgeville Dungeon. I'll be here when
you need a new task.

That's all thanks.
