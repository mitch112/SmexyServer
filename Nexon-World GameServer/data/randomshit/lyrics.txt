She said
"Don't, don't let it go to your head
Boys like you are a dime a dozen,
Boys like you are a dime a dozen"
She said
"You're a touch overrated,
You're a lush and I hate it
But these grass stains on my knees
They won't mean a thing"

Blue eyess sayyyy love me or I dieee
Brown eyes sayyyy love me or I kill youuu

Rest in peace girl, your death is such a shame (I'd never lie to you)
The paper said a bullet got in your way
But I smell foul play, possible poisoning (Unless I had to, I'll do what I got to)
I had to bring you in for questioning (I'll do what I got to, unless I had to)
I went to your grave, dug up your body (And with my one last gasping breath)
Brought it to my house, where you lay (I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt)

And all I
Need to know
Is that I'm something you'll be missing
Maybe I should hate you for this (So let's play doctor babe)
Never really did ever quite get that far
Maybe I should hate you for this
Never really did ever quite get that... (You could help solve this case)
For me

'Cause I'm a wishful thinker with the worst intentions
This will be the last chance you get to drop my name

'Cause I'm a wishful… Get to drop my name

If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar (Maybe I should...)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar (... hate you for this)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar (Maybe I should...)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar (... hate you for this)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar (Maybe I should...)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar (... hate you for this)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar (Maybe I should...)
If I'm just bad news, then you're a liar (... hate you for this)

So let's play doctor babe
We'll operate today
Incisions must be made
You could help solve this case
For me...
